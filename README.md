# Apache Geode examples

This is the home of Apache Geode examples that are bundled with the project. Contributions<sup>[2]</sup> and corrections are welcome. Please talk to us about your suggestions at [dev@geode.apache.org](mailto:dev@geode.apache.org) or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/new/develop).

## Example requirements

All examples:

*  Need to be testable. Use unit tests, integration tests or whatever is applicable. Tests will run through the project's CI.
*  Should be `Gradle` projects or part of existing ones. There may be exceptions here, but the community should have a consensus to accept.
*  Have to follow code format & style from Apache Geode <sup>[1]</sup> guidelines.
*  Should contain a `README.md` file with step-by-step instruction on how to set up and run the example. *Diagrams give you extra credit.*
*  Donations need to be licensed through ASL 2.0 and contributors need to file an ICLA<sup>[3]</sup>.

## Structure

### Installation and a Tutorial for Beginners

*  [How to Install](http://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/11/getting_started/installation/install_standalone.html)
*  Set a `GEODE_HOME` environment variable to point to the root directory of the installation; this directory contains `bin/`. For those that have built from source, it will be the `/path/to/geode/geode-assembly/build/install/apache-geode` directory.
*  If desired run the tutorial: [Apache Geode in 15 minutes or Less](http://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/11/getting_started/15_minute_quickstart_gfsh.html)

## Export Control

This distribution includes cryptographic software.
The country in which you currently reside may have restrictions
on the import, possession, use, and/or re-export to another country,
of encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software,
please check your country's laws, regulations and policies
concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of
encryption software, to see if this is permitted.
See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more information.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS),
has classified this software as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1,
which includes information security software using or performing
cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms.
The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation distribution makes
it eligible for export under the License Exception
ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception
(see the BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13)
for both object code and source code.

The following provides more details on the included cryptographic software:

* Apache Geode is designed to be used with
  [Java Secure Socket Extension](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html) (JSSE) and
  [Java Cryptography Extension](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html) (JCE).
  The [JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html)
  may need to be installed separately to use keystore passwords with 7 or more characters.
* Apache Geode links to and uses [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) ciphers.
