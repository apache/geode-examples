# Geode cache loader example

This is a simple example that demonstrates loading values using a
`CacheLoader`.  Invoking `Region.get()` causes the `CacheLoader` to
produce a value that is stored in the region.  This approach is
commonly used to fetch data from other systems like a database.

This example assumes you have installed Java and Geode.

## Steps

1. From the `geode-examples/loader` directory, build the example and
   run unit tests

        $ ../gradlew build

2. Next start the locator and two servers

        $ ../gradlew start

3. Run the example to load the entries

        $ ../gradlew run

    The example fetches the entries twice.  The first retrieval is slow,
    simulating a network call.  Subsequent retrievals are much faster since the
    values are stored in the cache.  The loader logs requests into the Geode
    server logs.  You can find those at `build/server1/server1.log` or
    `build/server2/server2.log`.

4. Shut down the system:

        $ ../gradlew stop
